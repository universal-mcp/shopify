# ShopifyApp MCP Server

An MCP Server for the ShopifyApp API.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Python 3.11+ (Recommended)
* [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed globally (`pip install uv`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running:

### 1. Sync Project Dependencies
Navigate to the project root directory (where `pyproject.toml` is located).
```bash
uv sync
```
This command uses `uv` to install all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` into a virtual environment (`.venv`) located in the project root.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activating the virtual environment ensures that you are using the project's specific dependencies and Python interpreter.
- On **Linux/macOS**:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- On **Windows**:
```bash
.venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

### 3. Start the MCP Inspector
Use the MCP CLI to start the application in development mode.
```bash
mcp dev src/shopifyapp/mcp.py
```
The MCP inspector should now be running. Check the console output for the exact address and port.

## üîå Supported Integrations

- AgentR
- API Key (Coming Soon)
- OAuth (Coming Soon)
