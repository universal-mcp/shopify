# Universal Mcp Shopify MCP Server

An MCP Server for the Universal Mcp Shopify API.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Python 3.11+ (Recommended)
* [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed globally (`pip install uv`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running:

### 1. Sync Project Dependencies
Navigate to the project root directory (where `pyproject.toml` is located).
```bash
uv sync
```
This command uses `uv` to install all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` into a virtual environment (`.venv`) located in the project root.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activating the virtual environment ensures that you are using the project's specific dependencies and Python interpreter.
- On **Linux/macOS**:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- On **Windows**:
```bash
.venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

### 3. Start the MCP Inspector
Use the MCP CLI to start the application in development mode.
```bash
mcp dev src/universal mcp shopify/mcp.py
```
The MCP inspector should now be running. Check the console output for the exact address and port.

## üîå Supported Integrations

- AgentR
- API Key (Coming Soon)
- OAuth (Coming Soon)

There might be times when a draft order is created but these calculations haven't completed. In these cases, you need to poll the draft order until the calculations are finished. <br> When a draft order requires polling, a <code>202 accepted</code> response code is returned along with <code>location</code> and <code>retry-after</code> response headers. The <code>location</code> header refers to the URL to be polled, and <code>retry-after</code> denotes the interval (in seconds) at which polling requests should be sent. When the draft order is ready, a <code>200 OK</code> response code will be returned. <h3>About custom shipping lines</h3> You can use the DraftOrder resource to send orders with custom shipping lines. A custom shipping line includes a <code>title</code> and <code>price</code> with <code>handle</code> set to <code>Nil</code>. A shipping line with a carrier provided shipping rate (currently set via the Shopify admin) includes the shipping rate handle. <h3>Applying discounts</h3> <p>A draft order and its line items can have one discount each. Calculations for discounts are based on the setting of the <code>value_type</code> property, which can be set to either <code>fixed_amount</code> or <code>percentage</code>. For example, you can apply a fixed amount discount to a draft order to reduce the price by the specified <code>value</code> property. When you use a percentage discount, the discount <code>amount</code> property is the price multiplied by the <code>value</code> property. For line item discounts, the <code>value</code> property is applied per individual unit of the item, based on the line item's quantity.</p> <br> <p><strong>Calculating line item discount amounts</strong></p> <p>For <code>fixed_amount</code> discounts, the total <code>amount</code> corresponds to the line item quantity times the value of the discount. For percentage discounts, the total amount corresponds to the following:</p> <br> <p><code>amount = floor(price * quantity * value) / 100</code>, where <code>floor()</code> is the usual round down function.</p> <br> <p>For non-fractional currencies, this formula needs to use round() instead of floor(), and the division by 100 takes place inside the rounding, resulting in a non-fractional value. Otherwise, an error is returned.</p> <br> <p><code>amount = round(price * quantity * value / 100)</code></p> <br> <strong>Line item examples</strong> <br> <p><i>Fixed amount discount</i></p> <p>For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with $5 dollars off, discount amount corresponds to $10 ($5 * 2):</p> <br> <p><code>applied_discount: { "value_type": "fixed_amount", "value": 5, "amount": 10 }</code></p> <br> <p>For a fixed amount example, see <a href="#create-a-draft-order-with-a-discount-"><i>Create a draft order with a discount</i></a>.</p> <br> <p><i>Percentage discount</i></p> <p>For a $19.99 line item with quantity of 2 and with 15% off, discount amount corresponds to $5.99 (floor ($19.99 * 2 * 15) / 100):</p> <br> <p><code>applied_discount: { "value_type": "percentage", "value": 15, "amount": 5.99 }</code></p> <br> <p>For a percentage example, see <a href="#create-a-percent-discount-on-a-line-item-"><i>Create a percent discount on a line item</i></a>.</p> <h3>Loading and removing customers</h3> <p>You can load a customer to a draft order by sending the <code>customer_id</code> as part of the draft order object. The recommended way to remove a customer from a draft order is to make a POST request with the Customer object set to null, without specifying an email, shipping address, or billing address. A customer may also be removed by setting <code>customer</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>shipping_address</code>, and <code>billing_address</code> to <code>null</code>. </p> |

| `create_anew_fulfillment` | Create a new Fulfillment. <p>Create a fulfillment for the specified order and line items.</p> <p>The fulfillment's status depends on the line items in the order: <ul> <li>If the line items in the fulfillment use a manual or custom fulfillment service, then the status of the returned fulfillment will be set immediately.</li> <li>If the line items use an external fulfillment service, then they will be queued for fulfillment and the status will be set to <strong>pending</strong> until the external fulfillment service has been invoked.</li> </ul></p> <br/> <p>A fulfillment might then transition to <strong>open</strong>, which implies it is being processed by the service, before transitioning to <strong>success</strong> when the items have shipped. If you don't specify line item IDs, then all unfulfilled and partially fulfilled line items for the order will be fulfilled. However, if an order is refunded or if any of its individual line items are refunded, then the order can't be fulfilled.</p> <br/> <p>All line items being fulfilled must have the same fulfillment service.</p> <br/> <aside class="note"> <h4>Note</h4> <p>If you are using this endpoint with a Partner development store or a trial store, then you can create no more than 5 new fulfillments per minute.</p> </aside> <h3>About tracking urls</h3> <p>If you're creating a fulfillment for a supported carrier, then you can send the <code>tracking_company</code> and <code>tracking_numbers</code> fields, and Shopify will generate the <code>tracking_url</code> for you. If you're creating a fulfillment for an unsupported carrier (not in the <code>tracking_company</code> list), then send the <code>tracking_company</code>, <code>tracking_numbers</code>, and <code>tracking_urls</code> fields.</p> <br/> <aside class="note"> <h4>Note</h4> <p>If you send an unsupported carrier without a tracking URL, then Shopify will still try to generate a valid tracking URL by using pattern matching on the tracking number.</p> </aside> |
